# ChatBot
It's just a sample app to talk to a chat server.
Once installed, just open the app and type whatever message you like and click on "Send" button.
You will get the reply from the chat server. We are using Json.
The API server is been hosted on http://www.personalityforge.com/api/chat/ 
HTTP requests are done using the Volley library.
